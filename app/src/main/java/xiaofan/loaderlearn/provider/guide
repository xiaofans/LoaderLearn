## this is from the book, hello android 3rd.

Any piece of information managed by a ContentProvider is addressed
through a URI that looks like this:
content://authority/path/id
where:
• content:// is the standard required prefix.
• authority is the name of the provider. Using your fully qualified
package name is recommended to prevent name collisions.
• path is a virtual directory within the provider that identifies the
kind of data being requested.
• id is the primary key of a specific record being requested. To
request all records of a particular type, omit this and the trailing
slash.
Android comes with several providers already built in, including the
following:3
• content://browser
• content://contacts
• content://media
• content://settings
